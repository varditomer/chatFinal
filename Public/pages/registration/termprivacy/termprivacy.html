                a) Determine the procedure at and for the Mediation to include the submission of any documents to the Mediator or between the Parties prior to the Mediation;
                
                b) Chair the Mediation;
                
                c) Facilitate the drawing up of any settlement agreement at the Mediation.
                
                3. Neither the Mediator nor Mediation1st nor any employee of mediation1st shall act for any of the Parties in connection with the Dispute.
                
                4. The Parties accept that neither the Mediator nor Mediation1st is acting as agent for the Parties in connection with the Dispute and that neither the Mediator nor Mediation1st will offer legal advice to the Parties and that no comments made by the Mediator during the Mediation should be construed as legal advice.
                
                The Parties
                5. The Parties will send to the Mediation negotiators who have sufficient authority to settle or compromise the Dispute. If there are any restrictions on the authority of the persons attending the Mediation on behalf of any of the Parties they will disclose the same to the Mediator as soon as practicable and in any event before the Mediation.
                
                6. The Parties will comply with any directions made by the Mediator under paragraph 2 of this Agreement as to the conduct of the Mediation or as to the submission of any documents to the Mediator or to any other Party prior to the Mediation.
                
                The Mediation
                7. The Mediator shall mediate the Dispute at the venue agreed by the Parties or (as the case may be) online (“the Mediation”) on the Mediation Date.

                8. No recording or transcript of the Mediation will be made.
                
                9. The Parties will attend the Mediation to attempt to negotiate a settlement of the Dispute but no offer, proposals or comment made at the Mediation will constitute a binding offer or agreement until the same are committed to writing and signed by all the Parties.
                
                10. If the Parties are unable to reach a settlement at the Mediation the Mediator may, if all the Parties so request, produce a non binding recommendation on possible terms of settlement but the Mediator shall, even if all Parties so request, be under no obligation so to do. Any such recommendation shall not represent legal advice to the Parties nor will it represent an opinion as to what a court or tribunal might order but it will set out what the Mediator considers are appropriate terms of settlement in all the circumstances.
                
                11. Any of the Parties may withdraw from the Mediation at any time whereupon the Mediation will terminate.

                f) By any of the Parties or by the Mediator or Mediation1st to the appropriate authority or person in so far as they reasonably consider that there is a serious risk of harm to the life or safety of any person if the information in question is not disclosed;
